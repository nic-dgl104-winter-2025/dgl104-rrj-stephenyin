## Notes: Functional Requirements and User Stories

### User Stories

1. **What are User Stories?**
   - Written in natural language
   - Format: "As a user, I can do something"
   - Used to describe user activities in software/apps

2. **Benefits of User Stories**
   - Great for team communication
   - Clear and easy to understand
   - Helps everyone stay on the same page

3. **Limitations of User Stories**
   - Lack technical implementation details
   - May miss performance requirements
   - Can overlook technical issues
   - Too many technical details make them less useful for stakeholders

### Technical Design Document (TDD)

1. **What is a TDD?**
   - Written document (Word, Wiki, etc.)
   - Specifies technologies to be used
   - Maintains high-level scope

2. **When is it Used?**
   - Mainly in early development stages
   - Becomes less relevant once coding starts
   - Code becomes the main source of truth

3. **What it Includes**
   - Software architecture
   - Feature implementation details
   - Testing plans
   - Performance criteria

### Functional Requirements

#### **What are Functional Requirements?**

- Describe software features using input/output
- Similar to programming functions
- Can be included in TDD or separate document

## Language Research

### **What is the Lua used for?**

- Lua is a lightweight, embeddable scripting language used for game development, web applications, IoT devices, and extending software like Wireshark, Adobe Lightroom or Roblox.

### **Who uses the Lua?**

- Developers in gaming like World of Warcraft and Angry Birds, embedded systems engineers creating mods or scripts use Lua.

### **What are some useful resources?**

- Offical website: Lua.org
- Book:Programming in Lua
- Wiki: Lua Users Wiki
- Website: Stack Overflow

## User Story for the [AllTrails](https://www.alltrails.com/):

- "As a user, I can open a map to find nearby hiking trails."
- "As a user, I can save a trail to my favorites list for future hikes."
- "As a user, I can log my completed hikes to track my progress."
- "As a user, I can upload photos and reviews of a trail after completing it."
- "As a user, I can download a trail map for offline use during a hike."
- "As a user, I can share a trail with friends from the app."

## Project progress

- Made a group with Wakako
- Chosen Tech stack
- Completed the initial architecture for class, sequence, and database in the first phase
- The second phase will be completed through a division of work.
