## Notes: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

### What is OOP?

- A way of programming based on objects
- Objects can contain:
  - Data (properties/attributes)
  - Code (methods/functions)

### Main OOP Concepts

1. Classes
   - Like blueprints for objects
   - Define what objects should look like
   - Can create many objects from one class

2. Encapsulation
   - Hiding data inside classes
   - Using private/protected keywords
   - Keeps data safe from outside changes

3. Inheritance
   - Classes can inherit from other classes
   - Child classes get features from parent classes
   - Helps avoid repeating code

4. Polymorphism
   - Objects can act as different types
   - Like a child class can act as its parent class
   - Makes code more flexible

### Programming Paradigms

1. Imperative (like OOP)
   - Tells computer exactly what to do
   - Uses if statements, loops
   - Step-by-step instructions

2. Declarative (like Functional)
   - Tells computer what to achieve
   - Less focus on how to do it
   - Good for UI development

### When to Use OOP

- Good for real-world problems
- Good when modeling things with data and behavior
- Not always best for simple data processing
