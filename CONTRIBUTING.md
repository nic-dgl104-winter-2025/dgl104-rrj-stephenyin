## Overview

By default, people might need to follow GitHub’s usual steps (fork, submit a PR) and talk to the author through issues or directly.

I usually contribute to a project by forking a repository, modifying the code, testing it, and submitting a PR.

[My code repository](https://github.com/stephenyin/tcconfig) was forked from [this repository](https://github.com/thombashi/tcconfig) many years ago, and I implemented some new features and bug fixes. So far, not all of the PRs have been merged back into the original project. I’ve just been using it as my own tool.
